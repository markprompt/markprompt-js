# Markprompt React

[Markprompt](https://markprompt.com)'s `@markprompt/react` library offers you
both a simple, accessible, prebuilt React component that you can include in your
codebase, as well as a set of React primitives that you can use to build your
own custom Markprompt UI.

The `<Markprompt />` component is built with [Radix'](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
[`Dialog component`](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog)
and allows for limited control over the Markprompt UI, mostly offering you the
ability to change texts as well as how prompt references and search results are
linked to your website.

The `Markprompt.*` primitives offer you a fully customizable way to build your
own UI and have full control.

In combination with
[`@markprompt/css`](https://github.com/motifland/markprompt-js/tree/main/packages/css),
the `<Markprompt />` component is a drop-in solution for most websites. You can
also opt to provide your own styles, or override ours to your liking.
