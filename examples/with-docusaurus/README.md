# Example with Docusaurus search plugin

This example shows you how to use Markprompt in [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) using the `@markprompt/docusaurus-theme-search` plugin.

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

## Local development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Using with other search plugins

If you are using another search plugin, such as [theme-search-algolia](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/themes/@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia), please refer to the [Docusaurus example with swizzling](https://github.com/motifland/markprompt-js/tree/main/examples/with-docusaurus-swizzled), which allows you to run both at the same time.
