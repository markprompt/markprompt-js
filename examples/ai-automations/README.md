# AI Automations

A Next.js application that triggers automations via API calls, such as cancelling a subscription or processing a refund.

Note: this example currently uses a yet unreleased version of the Markprompt SDK, copied verbatim in the `lib/core` folder. This will soon be removed and work with a single import statement from `@markprompt/core`.

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
