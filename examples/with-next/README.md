# `with-next`

This example contains a reference implementation of
[`@markprompt/react`](../../packages/react/README.md) with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

It also contains an example of using the exported context provider to manage the
state of the prompt, conditionally showing a loading state and references.
